How you wish you could have a perfect manicured lawn everyday without the hassles of maintaining it. Now you can with our Prime Turf Synthetic Grass. It looks so real that you can't believe itâ€™s artificial. Here's why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our synthetic grass is a very exceptional 30mm thick, which gives it the lush touch and feel of natural grass. Plus, the artificial grass is produced with a combination of olive and green straight yarn, beige curl yarn and dark green yarn to present it with realistic hues and tones. The similarity to real grass is uncanny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The polyethylene (PE) material used to manufacture the turf is chosen for its excellent properties, such as good resistance to wear, minimal moisture absorption and great electrical insulation to name a few. Nothing like those cheaper alternatives that compromise on quality to sell cheaper. Equally important, the backing of the turf encourages quick drainage and holds fast to the ground, even without any taping. The unique characteristics of our turf are only possible because the manufacturing materials are sourced from reputable companies BASF and Sinopec that have proven reliability with their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't just use our Prime Turf artificial grass for your lawn. Lay it on rooftops, balconies, patios, around swimming pools or even install it on a wall to create a stunning conversational piece. It certainly gives going green a whole new perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br />\r\nDurable and dense multi-purpose grass<br />\r\n30mm thick<br />\r\nRealistic four tone hue<br />\r\nHigh quality materials<br />\r\nAnti-fade and UV stabilised<br />\r\nThick backing with drainage<br />\r\nEasy to cut and install<br />\r\nGlued or pegged down<br />\r\n6 years warranty</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong><br />\r\nMaterial: Polyethylene<br />\r\nPile height: 30mm<br />\r\nMachine gauge: 5/8inch<br />\r\nTufted Density (d/M2): 14700<br />\r\nStitch Rate (/10cm): 14<br />\r\nBacking Glue: PP non-woven cloth w/ SBR latex<br />\r\nYarn Denier (dtex): 12500<br />\r\nDimension: 10 square meter roll with 1 meter width<br />\r\nAssembly required: No<br />\r\nPlease note: The item comes in 1 package</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Package Content</strong><br />\r\n1 x 10SQM Synthetic Grass<br />\r\n</p><p><strong>Delivery excludes the following postcodes: </strong><br /> <strong>885, 2222, 2449, 2818, 2827, 2829, 2836, 2839, 2874, 2898, 3724, 4477</strong><br /> <strong>4490, 4626, 4822, 4871, 4875, 6044, 6209, 6224, 6290, 6442, 6536, 6562</strong><br /> <strong>6707, 6713, 6725, 6728, 6743, 6751, 6753, 6754, 7255, 7256, 7258, 7260</strong></p>\r\n",
